Beaker Beaker uses python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and pygame (https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
I, personally, find downloading new languages and such to be a
pain, which is why there's just a video showing what the game is.

If you do install python and pygame and have something that can run
the files, the file you run is BeakerBeakerMain.py
